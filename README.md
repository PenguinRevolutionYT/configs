<b>Configuration Files for the Penguin Revolution</b>

These are my confuration files that I have written/modified. You can use them as is or as a starting point for modification. Feel free to use them however you wish. All of these files are placed in the ".config" folder inside of your home folder. Some of these folders will have a "README" file inside of them for instructions on how to use them, some may have some instructions commented out inside of them.  Have fun and enjoy.
